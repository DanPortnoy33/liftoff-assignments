# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  The goal of our web application is to make a grocery list/meal prep application. This application will allow the user to both manually add grocery items to a list and to directly add them to a (Walmart shopping cart) for example for tentative purchase and direct order. Once the user has their grocery list in place they can use the items within said list to construct recipes using the ingredients that have been added to the list and have or will be purchased. Once these items are used they will be removed from the inventory allowing the user to know what ingredients they have left to make use of for further recipes and also allowing them to know what will need to be purchased in the future. I would also like to implement mutliple cookbook and meal plan options into our application allowing the "not so culinary minded person" aid in both recipe/meal plan construction and in the decision making process of items that they may or may not wish to order. Finally, I would like to add a social component to our application allowing each user to not only share their grocery lists/recipe ideas with family/friends (via SMS, email, social media etc.), but also the ability to access other user's profiles within the application; allowing them to see other user's grocery lists and how each person is utilizing the items within their list to construct their meals.
  Our application will not only be "user-friendly," but it will be geared towards "the average person." In the world we currently live in the "average person" works 40+ hours a week and has a plethora of other responsibilites that unfortunately create serious time constraints; impeding the amount of "free time" they have to truly do the things they love. The goal of our application is to "lighten the burden," even just a little. Nobody enjoys making a grocery list every week or coming up with ideas of what they should cook three times a day. Our primary aim is to help our user's make this process as easy as possible, all the while freeing up extra time for them to do the things they really enjoy. With that said, not only will our application make creating a grocery list each week easy, but it will also save the user precious time by providing multiple means of recipe and meal prep ideation.   
  
### Features
1. Registration/Login: Our application will allow our users to create a personalized account and will further authentiate said identity each time they login into their account using multi-factor authentication. (We will utilize the BCrypt hashing algorithm to securely store hashed passwords in our database providing the necessary security for our users. We will also need to implement some form of authorization especially if we add a social component to our app.)
2. Navigation Bar: Our application will utilize a navigation bar that easily allows the user to traverse the web page.
3. API's: Our application will connect the user to multiple recipe and meal plan API's providing them easy access to recipe and meal plan ideation/construction. 
4. Calender: Our application will have a calender that the user can use to add their meal choices to specific days. This will allow the user to have a visual representation of what their meal prep will look like for the day, week, month, etc. 
5. Search: There are multiple options for the search functionality that we can implement into our application including searching food items to add to user lists (individually or by food category), searching recipe ideas by ingredients, etc.
 
*This is just 5 prospective features. This is not a complete list of features within our application.

### What I'll Have to Learn
It is difficult for me to say exactly what I will need to learn for this project from this point, as I do not know exactly what features we will be implementing as a group, but I do know one thing I want and will need to learn more about is accessing and using API's.
